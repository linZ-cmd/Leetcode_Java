 * Testcase Example:  '{"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":4},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":5},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"5","left":null,"next":null,"right":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"val":3},"val":1}'
 *
 * Given a binary tree
 * 
 * 
 * struct Node {
 * ⁠ int val;
 * ⁠ Node *left;
 * ⁠ Node *right;
 * ⁠ Node *next;
 * }
 * 
 * 
 * Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no
 * next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
 * 
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":4},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":5},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"5","left":null,"next":null,"right":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"val":3},"val":1}
 * 
 * Output:
 * {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":{"$id":"5","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"right":null,"val":5},"right":null,"val":4},"next":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"5"},"val":3},"right":{"$ref":"4"},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"6"},"val":1}
 * 
 * Explanation: Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should
 * populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in
 * Figure B.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * You may only use constant extra space.
 * Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra
 * space for this problem.
